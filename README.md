# YTMP3++
---

`YTMP3++` is a terminal based (for now) Python application that converts YouTube videos (most likely songs) into mp3 files. For everyone like me who is too cheap to get Spotify :grin:.

## Installation
---

Unfortunately, the only way to use `YTMP3++` is by either cloning the repo or downloading the code. There are also a few libraries needed that can be installed with the following:

`$ pip install PyTube`
`$ pip install EyeD3`
`$ pip install moviepy`

It is also required that you have `FFMPEG` installed on your system. It should be installed whenever you install `moviepy`, but it seems that it doesn't always turn out that way :slightly_frowning_face:.

If it is not automatically installed, simply install it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for Windows and through brew for Mac, and set your path variables appropriately.

A better method is coming soon :smiling_face_with_tear:!

## Usage
---

After obtaining the files, run the `ytmp3++.py` file. The program will ask for Youtube links. When you are finished inputting videos, enter d to download all of the videos queued.
